    <h1>Television 5 Milestones</h1>
    <ul>
        <h2><li>Milestone 1</li></h2>
        <p class="don">The world’s first electronic television was created by a 21 year old inventor named Philo Taylor Farnsworth, John Baird, and Charles Jenkins wich they dispayed the first television in San Franciso in 1927. However, before electronic televesion they invented television stations in the late 1920s and early 1930s and aired its first broadcast in 1928.Antenna TV was made around the 1900s where you had to move around the antennas on top of the TV to find a good signal and watch TV. Prior to electric televisions, we had mechanical televisions which were displayed by John Logie Baird, and Charles Francis Jenkins in the earyl 1920s. These early televisions started appearing in the early 1800s. They involved mechanically scanning images then transmitting those images onto a screen.In 1927, multiple versions of televison came out with small screens and buttons you could roll up and down on the side of the TV. They also were big and in the shape of a box, the quality was not clear and there was no color, it was black and white.In 1943, they made progrees with the televisons like making it smaller including the screens and the size. It also received better quality and you could hear better. Finally in 1946-1950 color in Tv was invented which made more people buy them.In 1957 the scrolls that were on the side of the tv got moved down to the bottom so it would not interfere with the screen. At the end of 1957 almost every citizen of the U.S. had a TV.</p>

        <h2><li>Milestone 2</li></h2>
        <p class="vin">By 1960, they made them even smaller with more improvements by adding more buttons on the the television. However, in 1965 the picture quality had gotten worse, and you could hardly see whats going on, on the screen. Also, the screen of the TV was very thick because of the lack of technology that we did not have back then compared to what we have now.  They expanded the TV more by making it more square and made the speakers better to sound cinematic. As years pass, in 1985, there were more small improvements. They finally introduced remote controls instead of heaving to get up everytime you wanted to change the channel and turn the volume up or down. Again in 1990 nothing changed, but there were always small changes like the sound and graphics of the TV, but they were not important. They ended up not making any new changes through the 1990s until 1995.In 1995 there were huge improvements and changes on the TV. The buttons and scrolls were completely gone from the front-side of the TV. The screens got way bigger, and the TV got thinner on the sides. By this time everyone had a TV no matter what kind it was, and they were on it for an estimate of more than 8 hours a day. In the late 1990s the TVs were getting improved every chance they could get and one improvement you could see the most were the TVs kept getting smaller on the sides.</p>

        <h2><li>Milestone 3</li></h2>
        <p class="how">Fast forward to the 2000s, in 2006 there were more improvements to the TV. It was easier to add more improvements to the TV because of the better technology that they had received before 2000s.Cable TV channels were also making a name for itself during the 2000s. The Vcr’s were getting removed by DVD players.  They made the TV thinner and in 2010 the TVs started to look more like a flat screen TV. Flat screen TVs were trending in the 2010s and everybody wanted one. They also made the TV screens wider to make it look like a home theatre and look more cinematic. They also improved the sound on the TV, trying to make it sound all around you, so it feels like you are in the show while watching it. 2010 was also the year that you could watch Television on any mobile device and not just the actual TV making television portable. In 2015 more time was spent watching TV because of the better technology and more resources we had to make watching TV better. In 2015 TVs were also getting simpler by removing cords and buttons from the TV. The picture quality always got improved on each TV there were to make it look more realistic when watching TV. Plasma TV were one of the first flat screen TVs which is known for having great picture quality and doesn’t use much energy and they are available in larger sizes.</p>

        <h2><li>Milestone 4</li></h2>
        <p class="when">In 2016, the curved TV screens started making a name for themselves because of how thin they were some believed that it captured more of the picture. The graphics also got better with these curved TV images. In 2017, the curved TVs started getting bigger and people believed these curved TVs were more realistic to any TV they had invented before this one. Curved TVs allows viewers to have a better watching experience, because the curved images made it look like you were looking around the room because of the curved illusion. However, curved TVs only looked good when you sat really close to the screen. When watching curved TVs it doesn’t matter where you are sitting it’s made to make each angle of the TV good. Curved TVs are also better for your eyes because of the shape of our eyes and the images look sharper at the edges. Most people when watching curved TVs the images look more like a 3D image. Compared to flat screen TVs, flat screen TVs catches more reflections than curved TVs do, because curved TVs are more sensitive to reflections. The reason why we don’t see as many curved TVs now than we used to is because they were very expensive and flat screen TVs were affordable. People only bought curved TVs because they like the way looked although flat screen TVs ended up being the best option when being compare to a curved TV which is why we don’t see as many curved TVs than we used to. </p>
